## About 

VRAD (Vacation Rentals Around Denver), was an assigned paired project in Module 3 at Turing. We had 9 and a half days to complete this application in React, of which we are brand new to. The goal was to make an application that showed available homes to rent around the Denver area. The user can view a list of the four main areas that Denver is broken into, view specific homes in each area, and the details about each available home. The user starts by logging in with a username, an email, and a purpose for their trip to Denver. They can also favorite homes that they like, to save it for later, and see all of the homes they selected as a favorite. 

## Leanring Goals:

Our learning goals for this project was to understand the flow of react better. We also needed to impliment testing every component using react testing library, jest, and async/await testing.

### How to Set This Application Up:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
